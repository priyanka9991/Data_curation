# DepMap Public 22Q2

##############
## Overview ##
##############

This DepMap release contains data from CRISPR knockout screens from project Achilles, as well as genomic characterization data from the CCLE project.

###############
## Pipelines ##
###############

### Expression

CCLE expression data is quantified from RNAseq files using the GTEx pipelines. A detailed description of the pipelines and tool versions can be found here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/ccle_processing#rnaseq. We provide a subset of the data files outputted from this pipeline available on FireCloud. These are aligned to hg38.

### Copy number

CCLE WES copy number data is generated by running the GATK copy number pipeline aligned to hg38. Tutorials and descriptions of this method can be found here https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11682, https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11683. WES samples have been realigned to hg38 and run through this pipeline.

### Mutations

CCLE mutation calls are aggregated from several different sources and sequencing technologies.


### Omics Updates

 [Copy Number] Previously ACH-002345 and ACH-002291’s copy number data were from WES, and ACH-000901’s was from SNP array. This quarter, we processed WGS data for these three lines, so the source of their copy number data is now WGS.
[Copy Number and Mutation] HS571T (ACH-001092) and TOV112D (ACH-000048) are not isogenic according to Cellosaurus, but they are identified as isogenic in DepMap. Therefore, we decided to remove data for ACH-001092, which includes mutation from hybrid capture data, and copy number from SNP array data.
[Expression] We updated STAR to v2.7.10a, RSEM to v1.3.3, and GENCODE to version 38 (used for generating index for STAR and reference for RSEM) in our expression pipeline. In order to QC, we computed Spearman correlation tests between data generated by the old version and the updated version of the expression pipeline. On gene level, all cell lines’ correlation values are above 0.98. On transcript level, all cell lines’ correlation values are above 0.91 (averaged around 0.94). These results are reasonable and expected.

### README.txt

Description of all files

### CCLE_expression.csv

Pipeline: Expression

Gene expression TPM values of the protein coding genes for DepMap cell lines. Values are inferred from RNA-seq data using the RSEM tool and are reported after log2 transformation, using a pseudo-count of 1; log2(TPM+1).

Additional RNA-seq-based expression measurements are available for download as part of the full DepMap Data Release

More information on the DepMap Omics processing pipeline is available at <https://github.com/broadinstitute/depmap_omics>.

### CCLE_gene_cn.csv

Pipeline: Copy number

Gene-level copy number data that is log2 transformed with a pseudo-count of 1; log2(CN ratio + 1) . Inferred from WGS, WES or SNP array depending on the availability of the data type. Values are calculated by mapping genes onto the segment level calls and computing a weighted average along the genomic coordinate.

Additional copy number datasets are available for download as part of the full DepMap Data Release.

More information on the DepMap Omics processing pipeline is available at <https://github.com/broadinstitute/depmap_omics>.


### CCLE_expression_full.csv ###

Pipeline: Expression
RNAseq TPM gene expression data for all genes using RSEM. Log2 transformed, using a pseudo-count of 1.

Rows: cell lines (Broad IDs)
Columns: genes (HGNC symbol and Ensembl ID)

### CCLE_wes_gene_cn.csv

Pipeline: Copy number

Gene-level copy number data that is log2 transformed with a pseudo-count of 1. Inferred from only WES data by mapping genes onto the segment level calls.

Additional copy number datasets are available for download as part of the full DepMap Data Release.
